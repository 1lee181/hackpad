- Set up KiCad and the OPL library
- Watched a how-to-KiCad tutorial (https://youtu.be/3FGNw28xBr0?si=aM5QmcUhrOTXiS_H)
- Read KiCad documentation (https://docs.kicad.org/6.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html#:~:text=a%20PCB%20fabricator.-,Tutorial%20Part%201:%20Project,by%20opening%20the%20Schematic%20Editor.)
TL;DR: I had no clue what I was doing, so I had to research for clarification.
